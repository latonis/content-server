# content-server

I wanted to build something with go templates and htmx, so here we are. This is a webserver that loads pages via markdown and converts them to html (read: htmx, barely) and then delivers the content to the user.

I needed a mechanism for sharing my #100DaysofYARA content, so I decided to build one.
