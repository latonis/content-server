# 100 Days of Yara in 2024: Day 04
Back to parsing some more data from the Mach-O headers and your regularly scheduled programming. On day 02, we covered parsing UUID load commands, as it was some metadata that is generated and then included in the binary, *maybe*. If it is spoofed, we could possibly cluster on it if a malware author doesn't chage it for various parts of the development cycle. 

## Motivation
I'd like to continue that trend of parsing more data from the Mach-O binaries that allows us a similar view into the development environment or values assigned in metadata about the binary. As such, I chose to parse the `version_min_command` data structures. This covers the following load commands:
- `LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX`
- `LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS`
- `LC_VERSION_MIN_WATCHOS`
- `LC_VERSION_MIN_TVOS`

These pieces of metadata can be used to comb through numerous binaries and only find specific ones, filter out older (or newer) compiled binaries, and a lot more. I think there's some potential here for clustering too with combining it with other information that we can glean from development environments of TAs.

## Structure
The load commands all follow the same structure, the only difference is the actual initial `load_command` value that lets us know which device the data is for: macOS, iPhoneOS, WatchOS, or TVOS.
We'll open up that [`loader.h`](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-2050.18.24/EXTERNAL_HEADERS/mach-o/loader.h) file for the Mach-O header for reference.

```c
/*
 * The version_min_command contains the min OS version on which this 
 * binary was built to run.
 */
struct version_min_command {
    uint32_t	cmd;		/* LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX or
				   LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS  */
    uint32_t	cmdsize;	/* sizeof(struct min_version_command) */
    uint32_t	version;	/* X.Y.Z is encoded in nibbles xxxx.yy.zz */
    uint32_t	sdk;		/* X.Y.Z is encoded in nibbles xxxx.yy.zz */
};
```

## Parsing
We can see from the struct above, there's not too much here to parse. Theres two unsigned 32-bit integers we're concerned with: `version` and `sdk`. This is simple enough to parse with `nom`:
```rust
  let (input, version) = le_u32(input)?;
  let (input, sdk) = le_u32(input)?;
```

The fun part is parsing those integers into the appropriate version strings, which is encoded as `X.Y.Z is encoded in nibbles xxxx.yy.zz`. A nibble meaning 4 bits or half a byte. As such, we can parse the version numbers from the unsigned 32-bit integer and translate it into a string like so:
```rust
fn convert_to_version_string(decimal_number: u32) -> String {
    let major = decimal_number >> 16;
    let minor = (decimal_number >> 8) & 0xFF;
    let patch = decimal_number & 0xFF;
    format!("{}.{}.{}", major, minor, patch)
}
```

## Final Result

Looking at the goldenfiles used for testing, we can see the following is now being parsed:
```
  min_version_mac_os:
      cmd: 36
      cmdsize: 16
      version: "10.9.0"
      sdk: "10.10.0"
```
As with all previous days, I have created a PR ([#56](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara-x/pull/56)) for YARA-X :)
